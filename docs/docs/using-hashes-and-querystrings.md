title: Using Querystrings and Hashes
---

Sometimes it can be helpful to know exactly what your appâ€™s browser URL is at any given stage. To do that, Gatsby passes a `location` prop (generated by `@reach/router` which Gatsby uses under the hood) to any page component representing the user's current location. 

### How URLs map to `hash` and `search` props

`location` is an object with two keys you will likely care about: `hash` (the hash) and `search` (the querystring). 

For example, Gatsby's Showcase has a hash for use by screen readers called `reach-skip-nav`; if you go to [gatsbyjs.com/showcase#reach-skip-nav](/showcase/#reach-skip-nav), the `hash` will be `#reach-skip-nav`. 

For example, Gatsby's Showcase, filtered for only e-commerce sites, has a URL of [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/showcase/?filters%5B0%5D=E-commerce](/showcase/?filters%5B0%5D=E-commerce) and a `search` value of `?filters%5B0%5D=E-commerce`

### Accessing `location` prop from a page component

If you simply want to print out querystrings and hashes, you could write the following:

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.js
export default function Homepage( { location }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p> The current hash is { location.hash }</p>
      <p> The current querystring is { location.search }</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Feeding location prop into children

> Note: because a string with question marks, escaped characters, keys, and values can be difficult to deal with, we recommend the Javascript library [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) to work with querystrings.
